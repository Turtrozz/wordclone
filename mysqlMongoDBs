Mysql requires installation of time zone support,
It supports time zones by using the extensive time zone support database
mantained by The AILA-Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.
The databaase is a standard set of international time zones,rules, name
and locations.

An index is a data structure that optimizes searches, sequential data access,insertions, and deletions
Mysql uses indexes to improve performance and to support features that require order data
An index keeps a logical order to a set of data
If I want to find a particular row in a table, Access to a fast lookup of a unique index key is going to make
that very easy to do

Constraints create rules governing the behaviour of columns in your table
In relational database, it is common to have one table refer to another table by its
foreign keys




A trigger is an operation that is automatically performed when a specific database event occurs
A subselect is effectively a nested select statement.
The result of a nested select statement is effectively a table that usually exists in memory,but
it can always be used as you would use a table.Because of this, a select statement can be used as
a data source for another select statement.

/////////////////// Mongo DB Notes ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////



Mongo DB is an open source noSQL database that uses some form of JSON to store data.




MongoDB TOOLS:

MongoDB Process(Very important) is the MongoDb client, it is actually a javascript console; as a result, we will be writing
javascript to work with MongoDB databases.
You can start the shell/terminal by running the Mongo command to connect to the server, and then you will get your prompt

Other mongoDB tools are for administration and management; these are tools for importing and exporting data from a database. MongoDB
content is stored in BSON-this storage structure is similar to JSON.

You don't want to back up your data using JSON because it is a bad idea to store binary data,and as such you should use the mongodump command
to backup you mongoDB database data.

Mongodump command spits out a BSON data, that's actually binary data, and not text data.
To restore the binary data as dumped with mongodump command, you will have to use the 'Mongorestore' command, but
if you want to convert that BSON binary data to JSON, you can just use the 'bsondump' command

The 'mongostat' command provides some statistics about your mongo database.
BSON is JSON with two important additions/dinstinctions namely; 1. BSON is a binary representation of JSON, 2. It supports data types that
are beyond the standard javascript ones, the most important for MongoDB being the ObjectID data type, which is the default type that MongoDB uses for
unique items IDs in our database.

The statement 'use db' sets the variable 'db' to be our given database name database.The key word(db) is actually an object that we gonna use to start working/interacting with our database.

MongoDB does not create the database until we start storing data in it. 


-------------------------------- noSQL Database terms/concepts ------------------------------------------

Schema are table definitions such as columns, data types, constraints, etc.



NOSQL DATABASE VS RELATIONAL DATABASES/SQL

Collection (They usually don't follow schema, but you may enforce schema in your programming code,but it won't be enforced in your database, this means that
the records in your database collections don't need to be related in any way-they can have entirely different sets of fields[although, this is not a smart idea,
it is technically possible])
 = 'Table' (a Table in relational databases(They follow schema)

 DOCUMENT = 'ROW/RECORD' in relational databases

 FIELD(It is composed of a key and a value just like in a JSON)   = 'COLUMN' in relational databases



 ------------------------------ WORKING WITH MONGODB      -----------------------------------------------------

 Starting mongo db shell 'mongo'
 connecting to a database/creating one 'use'
 displaying databases 'show'
 creating a collection/table 'db.table.count()'
